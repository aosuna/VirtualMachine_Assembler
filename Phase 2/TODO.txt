NEED TO TEST IF I/O OPERATION WORKING CORRECTLY
NEED TO TEST IF SENDING FORM WAIT TO READYQ

NEED TO ADD TIME TO WAITQ OPERATION WHEN THERE IS NOTHING IN READYQ (NOT SURE WHAT TO ADD)


need to modify:
1:	Any Read, Write instructions need to be handled by PCB (NEED TO TEST)

TEST:
1: need to test new waitQ function. it checks if wait is not empty and compares main OS time, if time is
	in wait is less than time in main OS then send to ready. 
2: check if stack grew. need to test if working properly
3: return stack added, need to check if working properly 

Need to handle PCB:

1:	system clock
2:	prog's clock

PROGRESS:
1: modify your OS to handle programs with I/O
2: try several compute and I/O intensive programs. 
3: modify your OS to gather accounting information. 
4: modify your OS to handle programs with subroutine calls (which grow stack).
