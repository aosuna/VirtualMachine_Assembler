TODO

need to modify:
1:	Virtual Machine to read only from memory
2:	Only execute for only 15 clock ticks
3:	set system status codes (might be in os)
4:	Any Read, Write instructions need to be handled by OS

Need to handle PCB:
1:	Set running state of the prog
2:	system clock
3:	prog's clock
4:	system status
5:	set name of running prog

PROGRESS:
1: modify your OS to run only two programs without any I/O (just compute intensive .s programs). 
2: modify your OS to handle programs with I/O. 
3: try several compute and I/O intensive programs. 
4: modify your OS to gather accounting information. 
5: modify your OS to handle programs with subroutine calls (which grow stack).
