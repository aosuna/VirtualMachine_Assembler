TODO

TEST:
1: need check if IO is being performed on correct register
2: need to check if .st file is being loaded with the correct stact output
3: check if stack grew. need to test if working properly
4: return stack added, need to check if working properly 

Need to handle PCB:

1:	system clock
2:	prog's clock

PROGRESS:
1: modify your OS to handle programs with I/O 
2: try several compute and I/O intensive programs. 
3: modify your OS to gather accounting information. 
4: modify your OS to handle programs with subroutine calls (which grow stack).
